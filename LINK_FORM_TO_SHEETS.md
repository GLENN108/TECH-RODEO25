# How to Link Google Form to Google Sheets

## The Problem

Your form is submitting successfully ✅, and data appears in Google Form responses ✅, but it's **not showing in Google Sheets** ❌.

This means your Google Form is **not linked to a Google Sheet**.

## Solution: Link Your Form to Google Sheets

### Method 1: Create a New Sheet (Recommended)

1. Open your Google Form: https://forms.gle/VAuBwCRavZUriFjD7
2. Click on the **"Responses"** tab (at the top)
3. Click the **green Google Sheets icon** 📊 (it looks like a spreadsheet)
4. Choose one of these options:
   - **"Create a new spreadsheet"** - Creates a brand new Google Sheet
   - **"Select existing spreadsheet"** - Links to an existing sheet
5. Click **"Create"** or **"Select"**
6. Your form is now linked! All new responses will automatically appear in the sheet

### Method 2: Link to Existing Sheet

If you already have a Google Sheet:

1. Open your Google Form: https://forms.gle/VAuBwCRavZUriFjD7
2. Click on the **"Responses"** tab
3. Click the **three dots menu** (⋮) next to the Google Sheets icon
4. Select **"Select response destination"**
5. Choose **"Existing spreadsheet"**
6. Select your sheet from the list
7. Click **"Select"**

## Verify It's Working

1. Submit a test response through your registration form
2. Open your Google Sheet
3. You should see the data appear automatically (usually within 1-2 seconds)

## Important Notes

- **Historical data**: If you link the form to a sheet AFTER responses were submitted, the old responses won't automatically transfer. You'll need to manually export them or they'll only show new responses going forward.

- **Multiple sheets**: You can link one form to multiple sheets, but typically you link it to one main sheet.

- **Automatic sync**: Once linked, all new form submissions automatically appear in the sheet in real-time.

## Troubleshooting

### Data still not appearing?

1. **Check the sheet is linked**: 
   - Go to Form → Responses tab
   - You should see a green Google Sheets icon (not grayed out)
   - Click it to open the linked sheet

2. **Check the correct sheet**:
   - Make sure you're looking at the right Google Sheet
   - The sheet name usually matches your form name

3. **Refresh the sheet**:
   - Sometimes there's a small delay (1-2 seconds)
   - Try refreshing the Google Sheet page

4. **Check form settings**:
   - Make sure your form is set to "Accepting responses"
   - Go to Settings → Responses → Make sure "Accepting responses" is ON

## Quick Test

1. Link your form to a sheet (if not already linked)
2. Submit a test response through your registration form
3. Check the Google Sheet - data should appear automatically!

**Once you link the form to a sheet, all future submissions will automatically appear in the sheet!** 🎉
